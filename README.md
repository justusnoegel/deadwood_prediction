# Deadwood Prediction

Aim of this project is, to include the Simple Water Balance Model in order to improve the deadwood prediction. 

Workflow for the project: 
1. Analyse water balance evolution for the Harz region
2. Show significance of soil moisture 
3. Implement a machine learning model (Autogluon) with soil moisture as a predictor.
4. Further predictors can be included: soil data, NDVI, LAI, climate data


For the model prediction: 
* coarser resolution
* raster deadwood map
    * option1: take all raster where a deadtree was found 
    + option2: take the difference between each year
